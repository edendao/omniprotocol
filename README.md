# Eden Dao Protocol

Eden Dao is on a mission to bootstrap the regenerative economy.

As is often the case in crypto, we needed infrastructure that hadn't been built yet. We've spent months laboring over which chain to launch on, as many do.

This is too slow.

Eden Dao Protocol is a series of protocols designed to harmonize value and identity across the omnispace — the space on, between, and around the chains.

We build upon LayerZero Protocol. In the coming weeks, we will have support for: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, and Celo.

1. **Passport** is an omnichain identity protocol built around a synchronizable, soulbound NFT
2. **Domain** is how users and builders can securely write to space on _Passport_.
3. **Note** is the omnichain token with fast, no-slippage bridging.

## Welcome to Omnispace

**A letter from Cyrus**

To my fellow Eden Daoists,

We have been quietly building support for our movement, thoughtfully meditating on how we might align the frame of capitalism to unearth its hidden gem — regeneration as a source of wealth.

One of the biggest challenges I've had as the de-facto Chief Hype Officer of Eden Dao is the complexity of problem we're tackling. The more we explained carbon dioxide removal and the vital role of its hyperscaling in healing our planet back to pre-global-warming levels, the more surface area there was for critics and skeptics.

One of the biggest roadblocks to bringing the next billion users to crypto is how data is fractured across the chains. Imagine traveling to another country without a passport! But the effect this has on builders is even worse, as DAOs and entrepreneurs spend months deciding about what chain to launch on.

And we were met with a similar fate, that is, until we discovered LayerZero. LayerZero lets you build cross-chain apps that communicate through an oracle and relayer to bridge messages across chains. The possibilities are endless.

A moment of inspiration struck me on my flight over to Barcelona for Celo Connect. To be an Eden Daoist, among many things, means to be on a mission to bootstrap the regenerative economy. It also means that we observe the winds of fate, and adjust our sails.

I'm happy to announce the first set of protocols in Eden Dao Protocol. We've built a lot of exciting things for the public good.

## Eden Dao **Passport** is omnichain identity public goods infrastructure for DAOs and protocols.

This unlocks a fascinating new frontier. Users can carry their PFP with themselves across the chains. Builders can use Passport to sync user identity directly on-chain to let you carry your skills and credentials with you. Nifty social artists can reserve a spot on every passport to "stamp" with a tokenURI.

To learn more about Passport, check out the README: LINK. We're reviewing the codebase ahead of a launch in the next two weeks, and would greatly appreciate second looks!

## Eden Dao **Domain** is your omnispace airwave

For you, dear reader, starting today you can mint your own **Domain** NFT. These are your airwaves — Radio Stations may have 98.4 FM — and Gitcoin has Domain 69420. The holder of a Domain is the only one who can write and sync its reserved data slot on **Passport**. Is your application on Polygon, or Arbitrum? No worries, old friend. You can bridge that Domain to write data on your app's L2.

You can mint your first Domain by sending at least 0.05 ETH to the ConjureDeus Spell contract here: `0xADDY`. This will register the domain uniquely associated with your wallet address. For more control, head on over to Etherscan and call the `cast(uint256 domainId) payable` to mint a specific domain. At this point, every address may mint up to 5 domains.

## Eden Dao **Note** (EDN) is the omnichain token

EDN is the foundation for a new wave of omnichain value communication. As you interact with our protocol, you will have many opportunities to call `payable` contracts. For every ETH you gift, these contracts will honor you with 1,000 EDN tokens.

EDN is a powerful new social primitive for public goods. It can be bridged across the omnichains quickly and with no slippage, burning at the source to mint on the destination. Across omnispace, app developers can check the public goods reputation of a user.

## Funding the Public Good

The omnichain space overflows beyond blockchains and into our world. For but a brief moment, we ask that you take a moment to tune into the energy of our world, feel its pain, and suffering as we derail the natural cycles of our climate and head into biosphere collapse.

What is supremely valuable is our civilization's continued dignified flourishing in the world. We infuse our optimism for the future in the EDN token. Take these tokens of gratitude for your donation. We will use donations to fund the development of carbon removal projects for the public good of humankind.

If you're a DAO that's interested in rewarding their users with EDN tokens, we'd be excited to chat with you!

We're working with Endaoment.org to ensure this is tax-deductible. Which is why we have to make it absolutely clear that by making a contribution to the Eden Dao through its payable contract methods, you, the Contributor, donate Ethereum tokens (ETH) in order to receive EDN tokens solely for the Contributor’s own benefit and account, for the purposes of personal consumption and utilization of EDN tokens on the Omnichains and not for any speculative purpose or with an expectation of profit, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, a public offering or other distribution of EDN tokens, whether in exchange for other any other digital asset, any currency, any security or otherwise, and all of the foregoing remains true, accurate and complete on and as of the date of the contribution.
